# llm-on-k8s
Containerized LLM on Kubernetes

# Introduction
This guide provides insights on deploying two different APIs associated with Llama 2: one for text generation based on given prompts (llama-2) and another tailored for chat-based applications (llama-2-chat)

# Build and Deployment Process
1. Choose the Desired Model Directory: Navigate to either the llama-2 or llama-2-chat directory, based on the desired model.
2. Build the Docker Image: ```docker build -t your-image-name:your-tag .```
3. Deploy the Image to a Container: ```docker run --name your-container-name your-image-name:your-tag```

## Llama-2 Text Completion 
1. Server Health Check <br>
Endpoint: ```/``` <br>
Method: GET <br>
Purpose: Check if the server is running. <br>
Example: ```curl http://localhost:5000/```

2. Model Health Check <br>
Endpoint: ```/healthz``` <br>
Method: GET <br>
Purpose: Check if the model and GPU are properly initialized. <br>
Example: ```curl http://localhost:5000/healthz```

3. Shutdown <br>
Endpoint: ```/shutdown``` <br>
Method: POST <br>
Purpose: Shutdown server and program processes.  <br>
Example: ```curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/shutdown```

4. Complete Text <br>
Endpoint: ```/generate``` <br>
Method: POST <br>
Purpose: Complete text based on a given prompt. <br>
Example: 
```
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "prompts": [
               "I believe the meaning of life is",
               "Simply put, the theory of relativity states that ",
               "A brief message congratulating the team on the launch: Hi everyone, I just ",
               "Translate English to French: sea otter => loutre de mer, peppermint => menthe poivrÃ©e, plush girafe => girafe peluche, cheese =>"
           ],
           "parameters": {
               "max_gen_len": 128
           }
         }' \
     http://localhost:5000/generate
```

## Llama-2-chat Interaction
**Note:** Apart from the distinct chat interaction endpoint described below, all other endpoints (Server Health Check, Model Health Check, and Configure Generator) for Llama-2-chat are identical to those in Llama-2.

Chat Interaction <br>
Endpoint: ```/chat``` <br>
Method: POST <br>
Purpose: Facilitates chat-based text interactions. <br>
Example:
```
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "input_data": {
               "input_string": [
                   [
                       {
                           "role": "user",
                           "content": "what is the recipe of mayonnaise?"
                       }
                   ],
                   [

                       },

                           "content": "Paris, the capital of France, is known for its stunning architecture, art museums, historical landmarks, and romantic atmosphere. Here are some of the top attractions to see in Paris:1. The Eiffel Tower: The iconic Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and offers breathtaking views of the city. 2. The Louvre Museum: The Louvre is one of the worlds largest and most famous museums, housing an impressive collection of art and artifacts, including the Mona Lisa. 3.

               }
           }
         }' \
     http://localhost:5000/chat

# Conclusion
These APIs provide a streamlined approach to harness the capabilities of the Llama 2 model for both text generation and chat-oriented applications. Ensure the correct deployment and configuration for optimal utilization.
